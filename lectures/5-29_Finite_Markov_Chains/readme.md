Finite Markov Chains
====================

  - In this lecture, we will go over the [Finite Markov Chain lecture from QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/finite_markov.html)
  - We will pay close attention to Exercise 3, where we approximate a continuous state space markov process (an autoregressive process) with a finite state markov chain. https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/finite_markov.html#exercise-3
