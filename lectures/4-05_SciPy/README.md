Lecture 4/5 - Class 4
======================

 - Today's lecture will focus on learning the SciPy module. We will work through the lecture part of [QuantEcon: "SciPy"](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/scipy.html)
 - We will not solve the exercises at the end of the SciPy lecture. Instead, we will work through an exercise in Portfolio topimization [portfolio-optimization.ipynb](./portfolio-optimization.ipynb).
