Lecture 4/3 - Class 3
======================

 - Today's lecture will focus on learning the Numpy module. We will work through the lecture part of [QuantEcon: "Numpy"](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numpy.html)
 - We will not solve the exercises at the end of the Numpy lecture. Instead, we will work through some simple portfolio calculations in [portfolio-calculations.ipynb](./portfolio-calculations.ipynb).
 - If we have time remaning, we will talk about pull requests.
