# HW 6


 - **Paper Replication Exercises:** In this HW you will replicate Bresnahan and Reiss (1991). The assignment is laid out in `replicate-bresnahan-reiss-1991.ipynb`
 - **SQL Exercises:** Complete the reading and exercises as decribed below. Learning the basics of SQL is an important skill to have when working with data. Kaggle makes it easy to learn and practice data science tools. It is a great resource to get experience with.

This assignment is due on GitHub by **Wednesday, May 16th at 11:59 pm**.


# SQL Exercises:

**Read the Following:**

  - [Getting Started with SQL and BigQuery](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/getting-started-with-sql-and-bigquery)
  - [Select, From & Where](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/select-from-where)
  - [Group By, Having & Count](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/group-by-having-count/)
  - [Order By](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/order-by)
  - [As With](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/as-with/code)


Also, you may find this [industry survey about data science](https://www.kaggle.com/surveys/2017) interesting.

**Complete the Following Exercises:**

To complete this exercise, you will need to create an account on the website [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/). For each exercise, you can "Fork Notebook" and complete the exercise directly on Kaggle's website. When you are done, download each notebook and submit them in the usual way on GitHub. If you need further help with this, we will go over this in the TA session on Monday. 

Please complete the following Kaggle exercises, download the notebook with your solutions, and submit them as normal on GitHub:

*NOTES:* 

  - Sometimes the solution will ask for a large table of numbers---larger than is practical to print out. In those cases, just use something like `python_commits.head()` to print out the first 5 rows of the sought-after solution.
  - The concepts in these exercises should all look familiar from our previous work with Pandas. This should be mostly an exercise in learning SQL syntact. (In fact, some of the SQL syntax should remind you of Pandas too.)
