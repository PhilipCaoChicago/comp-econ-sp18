* Read the lectures ahead of time. The lectures (from, e.g., QuantEcon or the Python Data Science Handbook) have hyperlinks to the appropriate text.

**Books Used**

* [Lectures in ](https://lectures.quantecon.org/)[Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/), by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski (QuantEcon)
