Final Exam Review
=================

  - Review each HW assignment. Most HW assignments have included an application to economics. The final exam will ask some questions about some of these applications.
  - Be sure you are familiar with the questions and answers to the "Python Basics" portion from HW0.
  - The final exam will include a written portion and a coding portion, just like the midterm. The coding portfion will focus mostly on material from the second half of the course.
